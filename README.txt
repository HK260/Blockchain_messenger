Blockchain Messenger
Introduction
Welcome to the Blockchain Messenger, a smart contract designed for Ethereum that allows users to store messages directly on the blockchain. This smart contract provides a simple yet powerful way to communicate securely and transparently.

Features
Secure Storage: Messages are permanently stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring data integrity and security.
Privacy Controlled: The initial message is readable by everyone, but further interactions and messages are exclusive to the contract's creator.
Update Tracking: The contract includes functionality to track and display the number of times the message has been updated.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download it from Node.js official website.
Truffle Suite: We will use Truffle to compile and deploy the smart contract. Install Truffle by running npm install -g truffle.
MetaMask: A MetaMask wallet connected to the Ethereum network.

Usage
After deploying your contract, interact with it using Truffle or integrate it into a frontend with Web3.js:

Set a Message:
javascript
Copy code
const instance = await Messenger.deployed();
await instance.setMessage('Hello, blockchain world!', { from: yourAccount });
Read the Message:
javascript
Copy code
const message = await instance.getMessage({ from: yourAccount });
console.log('The stored message is: ' + message);
Update the Message:
